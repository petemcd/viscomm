    <p>I’m a freelance designer and developer. I partner and collaborate with people, organisations and companies to help them plan, design and ship great products that are simple, beautiful and easy to use.</p>

<p>As a classically trained graphic designer who writes code there are all sorts of ridiculous names for people like me — hybrid, devigner, unicorn.</p>

<p>But really, I’m at my most useful when I’m bridging the gap between design and development — designing things that can be built efficiently and ensuring that nothing gets lost in translation between design and development.</p>

<p>At the moment, I’m working on a new interface and living style guide for <a href="http://ti.to">ti.to</a>, an Irish company who make ticketing and event software. Recently I designed and built a new website for <a href="http://3fe.com">3fe.com</a>, a Dublin cafe that’s as famous around the world as it is in Dublin. And I’m currently acting as lead designer for Backplane, a startup based in San Francisco, who are building a new cloud routing service for developers.</p>

<p>Previously, I was lead designer on the Creative Technology team at Radical where I worked on a wide range of digital projects for clients including Toyota, Samsung, Mars, An Post and the Road Safety Authority of Ireland.</p>

<p>I’m at my best, and happiest, when I’m making products that are not only useful and beautiful, but that contribute towards making both the web and our world a better place.</p>

<p>If you’ve got a project you’d like to discuss drop me a message to <a href="mailto:hi@petermcdonagh.com">hi@petermcdonagh.com</a>, or say hi on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/petermcdonagh_">@petermcdonagh_</a>.</p>
